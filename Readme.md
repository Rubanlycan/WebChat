Hi Devlopers this is my learning project as a fullstack developer developed web based chat applications

tech stacks used => NextJS, TailwindCSS, NodeJS, MongoDB and Socket.IO

to test this project

prerequites
1. make sure nodeJS installed in your system
2. both client and server are present in same repo


 Run on your local machine
 first clone this repository on your local machine
 git clone https://github.com/Rubanlycan/WebChat.git

then go to the downloaded project folder path

change directory cd ./webchat_client for client ad cd ./webchat_server for server side
run Yarn or npm  install for server  and client seperately

after installing all packages 

split terminal for ./webchat_client  and ./webchat_server 

now run command yarn run dev for client side and yarn start for  server side

if all goes well then   go  to browser  and type http://localhost:3000 for client and http://localhost:5000 for server

*** Hurray now test the application *****
